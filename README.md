# spamgen

How can we get the word out on healthy, effective herbal remedies without being detected by Big Pharma? SpamGen!

## Installation

Clone this repository then `lein test`. Not much useful output. RSN. For now should just end with:
````bash
Ran 1 tests containing 0 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
````

## Usage

A standalone binary that can find its directories can be built thus:
````bash
cd <this repo top dir>
lein bin
cp bin/spamgen .
./spamgen -h
````
Now a multi-threaded processing of emails generated by `spec/gen` can be be kicked off with:
````bash
./spamgen -t1000 -m
````
If you now examine the directory `bulkmail` you should see a bunch of files name like 1.2.3.4.txt. Each begins with a header object showing the run date and suggested SMPTP server's ID.

The idea is that in parallel we cannot enforce sequential constraints, so the plan is to send each output file from a different SMTP server with the IPs shown.

Mind you, my paralellization is actually a bit slower than just running one one thread. Still working on that. To run single-threaded:
````
./spamgen -t1000
````
It is the default.

## Options

Try: `./spamgen -h`

### Bugs

Running in parallel (the `-m` option) is a tad slower. Investigating.

## Future work
Write a similar program to pull in the output files and validate that all constraints have in fact been observed, as our testing during development confirmed.
