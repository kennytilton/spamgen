# spamgen

Work in progress, especially this page.

## Installation

Clone this repository then `lein test`. Not much useful output. RSN. For now should just end with:
````bash
Ran 1 tests containing 0 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
````

## Usage

A standalone binary that can find its directories can be built thus:
````bash
cd <this repo top dir>
lein bin
cp bin/spamgen .
./spamgen -h
````
Now a multi-threaded processing of emails generated by `spec/gen` can be be kicked off with:
````bash
./spamgen -t1000 -m
````
If you now examine the directory `bulkmail` you should see a bunch of files name like 1.2.3.4.txt. The idea is that in parallel we cannot enforce sequential constraints, so the plan is to send each output file from a different SMTP server with the IPs shown.

Mind you, my paralellization is actually a bit slower than just running one one thread. Still working on that.

## Options

Try: `bin/spamgen -h`

### Bugs

Running in parallel (the `-m` option) is a tad slower. Investigating.
